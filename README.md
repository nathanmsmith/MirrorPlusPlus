# FAQ

**"Why isn't this on the App Store?"**

Apple rejected Mirror++ because they found it in violation of [guideline 2.11](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#functionality): 

> Apps that duplicate Apps already in the App Store may be rejected, particularly if there are many of them, such as fart, burp, flashlight, and Kama Sutra Apps

I personally disagree with this decision as I believe Mirror++ is better than most mirror apps currently on the App Store, but I understand Apple's reasoning. You can still run Mirror++ by downloading and compiling the code yourself!
